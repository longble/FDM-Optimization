Objective: Optimize 3D print time while maximizing strength.

Responses: Print Time (Minutes), 
	   Stress (Pa)

Factors: Number of outer shells (2-4)
	 Infill % (10%-40%)
	 Infill Pattern (Cubic, Gyroid) 
	 Extrusion Temperature (215-230C)
	 Nozzle Diameter (0.4mm, 0.6mm)

Standard layer height: 0.2mm
Standard Filament: PLA 
Filament will be dried at 55C for 24 hours prior to printing.
Speed of tensile testing: 5mm/min

Design: Split-Plot Design - Nozzle Diameter HTC
